/*
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers
from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3,
print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible
by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that
working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" , for numbers
that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz"
or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed
to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates.
So if you solved it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about
yourself. )
